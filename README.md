# HotBox

### The Problem
The planet is slowly giving up all its resources. The only U.S. spending 252 cubic feet of natural gas every day! There is always a limit. In the world of energy crisis. Everyone can contribute.

**HotBox** feature in your kitchen which will help the world.

The gas stove is one of the bigger eaters of energy in your house. Whenever you switch the pan while cooking or take a pause to cut ingredients do you remember to turn off the gas? 
*Hot Box will.* 


### The Solution
Hotbox controls the “Burning heads” and _laser distance sensor_ will know when you move the pan and will turn off gas automatically for you. 

Not enough? We got you!
Our optical _temperature sensor_ will see that you are cooking for a long time at a high temperature and send a notification to the screen to remind you that you can turn off the gas to **save energy** while your pan is still hot.
  - The average gas bill is €3,568 a year according to last year's statistics, as we all know prices are getting higher. (20,000 kWh per year).
  - Around 18% is spent on cooking.
  - We can reduce gas consumption by **at least 30%**, which is €200 less. 
  - Our product costs only €34.99

While making this product we were thinking of every group in society. With that price, everyone can install a hotbox on their stove.
Hotbox is an extremely energy-saving product. It is on only when you open the gas and off when the gas flow is off.
We choose to live green but with hot and tasty food. 

**HotBox**, _cook while saving the world._
